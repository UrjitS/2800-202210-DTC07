                            Getting in sync with your body’s natural sleep-wake cycle, or circadian rhythm, is one of
                            the most important strategies for sleeping better. If you keep a regular sleep-wake
                            schedule, you’ll feel much more refreshed and energized than if you sleep the same number of
                            hours at different times, even if you only alter your sleep schedule by an hour or two.


                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <span style="font-weight:bold">Try to go to sleep and get up at the same time every day.
                            </span>
                            When we pay attention to our breath, we are learning how to return to, and remain in, the
                            present moment—to anchor ourselves in the here and now on purpose, without judgement.
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            <span style="font-weight:bold"> Avoid sleeping in—even on weekends.</span> The more your
                            weekend/weekday sleep schedules differ, the worse the jetlag-like symptoms you’ll
                            experience. If you need to make up for a late night, opt for a daytime nap rather than
                            sleeping in. This allows you to pay off your sleep debt without disturbing your natural
                            sleep-wake rhythm.
                            <br>

                            <span style="font-weight:bold">Be smart about napping.</span> While napping is a good way to
                            make up for lost sleep, if you have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep at night,
                            napping can make things worse. Limit naps to 15 to 20 minutes in the early afternoon.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <span style="font-weight:bold">Start the day with a healthy breakfast.</span> Among lots of
                            other health benefits, eating a balanced breakfast can help sync up your biological clock by
                            letting your body know that it’s time to wake up and get going. Skipping breakfast on the
                            other hand, can delay your blood sugar rhythms, lower your energy, and increase your stress,
                            factors that may disrupt sleep.

                            <span style="font-weight:bold">Fight after-dinner drowsiness. </span>If you get sleepy way
                            before your bedtime, get off the couch and do something mildly stimulating, such as washing
                            the dishes, calling a friend, or getting clothes ready for the next day. If you give in to
                            the drowsiness, you may wake up later in the night and have trouble getting back to sleep.

                            Melatonin is a naturally occurring hormone controlled by light exposure that helps regulate
                            your sleep-wake cycle. Your brain secretes more melatonin when it’s dark—making you
                            sleepy—and less when it’s light—making you more alert. However, many aspects of modern life
                            can alter your body’s production of melatonin and shift your circadian rhythm. Here’s how to
                            influence your exposure to light:
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <span style="font-weight:bolder">-During the day-</span>
                            <br>


                            <span style="font-weight:bold">Expose yourself to bright sunlight in the morning.</span>The
                            closer to the time you get up, the better. Have your coffee outside, for example, or eat
                            breakfast by a sunny window. The light on your face will help you wake up

                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <span style="font-weight:bold">Spend more time outside during daylight.</span>Take your work
                            breaks outside in sunlight, exercise outside, or walk your dog during the day instead of at
                            night.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <span style="font-weight:bold">Let as much natural light into your home or workspace as
                                possible.</span> Keep curtains and blinds open during the day, and try to move your desk
                            closer to the window.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <span style="font-weight:bold">If necessary, use a light therapy box.</span>This simulates
                            sunshine and can be especially useful during short winter days.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <span style="font-weight:bolder">-At night-</span>
                            <br>

                            <span style="font-weight:bold">Avoid bright screens within 1-2 hours of your
                                bedtime.</span>The blue light emitted by your phone, tablet, computer, or TV is
                            especially disruptive. You can minimize the impact by using devices with smaller screens,
                            turning the brightness down, or using light-altering software such as f.lux.

                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <span style="font-weight:bold">Say no to late-night television.</span>Not only does the
                            light from a TV suppress melatonin, but many programs are stimulating rather than relaxing.
                            Try listening to music or audio books instead.


                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <span style="font-weight:bold">Don’t read with backlit devices.</span>Tablets that are
                            backlit are more disruptive than e-readers that don’t have their own light source.




                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <span style="font-weight:bold">When it’s time to sleep, make sure the room is
                                dark.</span>Use heavy curtains or shades to block light from windows, or try a sleep
                            mask. Also consider covering up electronics that emit light.



                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <span style="font-weight:bold">Keep the lights down if you get up during the night. </span>
                            If you need some light to move around safely, try installing a dim nightlight in the hall or
                            bathroom or using a small flashlight. This will make it easier for you to fall back to
                            sleep.

                            People who exercise regularly sleep better at night and feel less sleepy during the day.
                            Regular exercise also improves the symptoms of insomnia and sleep apnea and increases the
                            amount of time you spend in the deep, restorative stages of sleep.

                            <ul>
                                <li> The more vigorously you exercise, the more powerful the sleep benefits. But even
                                    light exercise—such as walking for just 10 minutes a day—improves sleep quality.
                                <li> It can take several months of regular activity before you experience the full
                                    sleep-promoting effects. So be patient and focus on building an exercise habit that
                                    sticks.
                            </ul>

                            <span style="font-weight:bold"> For better sleep, time your exercise right </span>
                            Exercise speeds up your metabolism, elevates body temperature, and stimulates hormones such
                            as cortisol. This isn’t a problem if you’re exercising in the morning or afternoon, but too
                            close to bed and it can interfere with sleep.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Try to finish moderate to vigorous workouts at least three hours before bedtime. If you’re
                            still experiencing sleep difficulties, move your workouts even earlier. Relaxing, low-impact
                            exercises such as yoga or gentle stretching in the evening can help promote sleep.

                                Sleep helps you maintain your physical abilities. Studies show sleep deprivation leads
                                to short-term balance problems.

                                That's called postural instability.6 It can lead to injuries and falls. Even mild
                                instability can cause problems during sports or exercise.

                                A good night's sleep makes you feel energized and alert. This helps you focus and get
                                things done.

                                It's easier to exercise when you're energetic and alert. So that's an indirect benefit
                                of getting enough sleep.

                                Being engaged and active throughout your day feels good. And being more active all day
                                makes another good night's sleep more likely.
